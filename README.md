# Classification - Loan Approval

Building Logistic Regression, KNN and Decision Tree models to predict whether a client will default on their loan and should be pre-approved. To compare each model's performance we use the Recall Score. Including client presentation. 

The models includes the use of:

* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boost
* XGradient Boost
* CatBoost

and the following libraries:

* SKLearn (Model-building)
* Seaborn (Visualization)
* PyMySQL (Datapull)

My Model was able to correctly identify defaulting customers **100%** of the time.
